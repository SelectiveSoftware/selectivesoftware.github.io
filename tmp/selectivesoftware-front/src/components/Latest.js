                        <p>This client was looking for a static website. Our process involved drawing up inital various designs for the client, before getting feedback and working on the designs interatively.</p>
                        <p>Once the design phase was complete, we built and hosted the website for the client.
                           During the process of understanding the clients business, we suggested other ideas where technology could help the clients business. A couple of which the client is investigating, if they are viable and would help the business.</p>
